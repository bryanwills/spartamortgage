        <div class="review-card one">
          Terry says: I needed a mortgage and asked my brother to suggest
          someone to help me. Kevin suggested Nathan Delpapa with Mortgage with
          Nathan. From the very start Nathan was upbeat and positive. He gave me
          confidence in the process. He told me what I would need and let me
          know he would be there throughout. He was! When I had questions he
          answered them in terms I could understand and relate. When I had my
          doubts Nathan pushed them out of my head. Nathan pushed and prodded me
          along to get MY homework done. I had some bumps in the road Nathan was
          there to help me through. When my mortgage came through he guided me
          through the closing, was in contact with me and my lawyers to make it
          as smooth as possible. Right through the end. He's a friend, a
          confidant and a mortgage guru all in one, I couldn't have done this
          without Nathan Delpapa and nathan@mortgagewithnathaâ€¦. Nathan your
          number 1 in my book. Can't thank you enough. If you need a mortgage
          you need Nathan Delpapa
        </div>
        <div class="review-card two">
          Johnny says: My husband and I had the pleasure of working with Nathan.
          He eased the entire process of buying our dream home. Nathan is an
          excellent communicator and delivers on his promises of all the dates
          during the process. He also has a wonderful personality and we really
          enjoyed working with him. I would recommend him to any family or
          friend member. Thank you, Nathan, for the amazing service!!
        </div>

        <div class="review-card three">
          Howard says: Nathan provided excellent service during our VA home loan
          search and with the purchase of our new home. We are first time home
          buyers and Nathan made the whole process a breeze and as stress free
          as possible. Nathan was calm and collected when things hit a snag and
          offered encouragement and assurance that the process was on track and
          everything would be fine. He was very prompt with updates and with
          requests from the underwriter. I will be using Nathan again in the
          future to refinance our VA loan and for a home improvement loan. I
          would recommend Nathan to any of my friends or family. I look forward
          to working with him again soon.
        </div>
        <div class="review-card four">
          Karen says: My experiences with Nathan were outstanding. He was very
          thorough in explaining the process of getting a mortgage to me. His
          response time to my questions and getting documents was highly
          effective in making the process quick and smooth. He was patient as I
          looked at different properties and worked with me until I found the
          right place. This guys is great, his business skills are unmatched,
          and he is very knowledgeable about what he does. I would certainly
          recommend him to anyone, especially if it's your first time.!
        </div>
        <div class="review-card five">
          Lynn says: Awesome Experience!! We had been told No in the past, our
          real estate agent put us in contact with Nathan. We call him the dream
          maker! He was able to work with our specific situation and get us the
          loan we needed for our Dream House! He was professional, straight
          forward, great to work with and definitely got the job done. We would
          recommend his services to anyone looking for a Mortgage Loan! Thank
          you Nathan for the great services you provide, we reached our goal
          because of you!!
        </div>
        <div class="review-card six">
          Jay says: We have worked through at least four deals with Nathan over
          the past 8 years. In each and every case, he has been very helpful,
          professional and thorough. He has also been very patient with us as we
          learned how to navigate the refinancing and home purchase process. He
          answered a million questions from us on the process and particulars
          until we were comfortable. That was no small task at times and his
          professionalism, empathy and understanding were amazing. He was able
          to find great rate options for us and significantly better than what
          we were able to get directly on our own. We have recommended Nathan to
          many friends and several of them have ended up using his services as
          well with great results. That's the best recommendation I can give.
          Almost all interactions with Swan Financial were direct with Nathan,
          however, in the few instances when Nathan wasn't available, his staff
          was great to work with too. I won't use another mortgage broker!
        </div>
        <div class="review-card seven">
          Demani says: Nathan processed a loan for one of my clients. I was
          surprised at how fast he was able to complete the loan. Nathan was
          very professional and eager to help with anything he could. It was a
          smooth and easy transaction thanks to Nathan. I would recommend Nathan
          to anyone. I look forward to working with him again.
        </div>
        <div class="review-card eight">
          Thai says: Nathan is a great Loan Officer! He is very thorough and
          precise! He treated my clients with respect and honesty, getting the a
          great rate on their VA Loan! Thanks Nathan!
        </div>
        <div class="review-card nine">
          Ellen says I cannot imagine a refinance going any smoother than it did
          with Nathan DelPapa. He is fast and efficient, but he did not make me
          feel rushed or like I was taking his time. He was careful to fully
          answer questions and address concerns. He presented me with options
          but never pushed me into anything. I was treated like an important
          customer who mattered to Nathan. He even sent someone to our house to
          sign the papers. I highly recommend Nathan DelPapa and will always go
          to him for my mortgage needs.
